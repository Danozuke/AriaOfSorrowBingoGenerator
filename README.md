#Castlevania Aria Of Sorrow Bingo Generator

This still needs a lot of development, but I'm just hoping to set a starting point for a tool that works with the Aria of Sorrow Randomizer.

This version (I don't have a version number yet) has: 25 different tasks that can include random numbers, souls names, enemies, and bosses. 5 tasks are hard coded. The order of the tasks changes every time the Generate button is clicked. The generated table listens to click and right click inputs to color the cells with 2 different colors. When clicking on a cell that has the other color, a 3rd color is placed. If a cell is clicked and already has the corresponding color, it will be set to white. I added a background image for the table just because all that white empty space looked grim.
